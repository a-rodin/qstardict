You need Qt >= 6.0 and glib >= 2.0 in order to compile QStarDict.

On Debian and Ubuntu these dependencies can be installed by running

   sudo apt install qt6-base-dev libglib2.0-dev build-essential

An additional runtime dependency is festival (or other TTS system, which
can be configured in QStarDict options). In order to install it on
Debiann or Ubuntu, run

    sudo apt install festival

If you have QtDBus module QStarDict, will be compiled with D-Bus support.

To disable D-Bus support add
    NO_DBUS=1
to qmake arguments.

To disable translations add
    NO_TRANSLATIONS=1
to qmake arguments.

If you want to select plugins to compile add
    ENABLED_PLUGINS="plugin1 plugin2 ..."
to qmake arguments.
Available plugins:
    * stardict - supports StarDict dictionaries
    * web - supports any web search engine
    * swac - supports SWAC speaking system (http://shtooka.net)
    * multitran - supports Multitran dictionaries (http://multitran.sourceforge.net)
By default the only "stardict" and "web" are plugins enabled.

By default the install prefix is /usr. To change it add
    INSTALL_PREFIX=<your prefix>
to qmake arguments.

To build and install:
1)	qmake [switches] # or qmake6 [switches]
2)	make
3)	sudo make install
